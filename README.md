# Final Year Project
## Sign & Spell VR: ISL Alphabet Practice and Sentence Construction in VR

**What is the Project idea?**  

My project is called Sign & Spell VR. It’s a virtual reality application that helps people learn 
Irish Sign Language (ISL) in an interactive, fun, and educational way. The idea is to let users 
go from learning ISL to spelling words, forming short sentences, and finally taking a small 
test to check what they’ve learned. It will run on the Meta Quest 3 provided in the XR 
Prototyping Module using Godot 4, and it tracks the user’s hand movements in real time to 
see if they are signing correctly. 
 
**Why is it useful/unique?**  

Most sign language learning tools focus on American Sign Language (ASL) and use videos or 
simple 2D animations. This project is different because it focuses on ISL and uses VR hand 
tracking so learning can practice in a 3D Environment. It also gives real-time feedback and 
doesn’t rely on machine learning, which keeps it fast and reliable. Later versions could add 
ML for better recognition and translation. 
 
**What does it offer (e.g., To the User)?**  

It offers users a way to practice ISL interactively instead of just watching videos. They can 
learn letters and words, combine them to make short sentences, and get feedback on how 
accurate their signs are. There’s also a test mode that checks what they remember and 
tracks their progress. 
 
**How will it Operate?**  

The app uses hand tracking from the Meta Quest 3, and the code will come from Godot 4. A 
simple rule-based compares hand positions to stored ISL sign templates. All the signs, 
words, and sentences are stored in JSON files, which makes it easier to update or expand 
later. 
 
**Why is this a good idea and what will the end deliverable be?**  

This project is a good idea because there aren’t many tools for learning ISL, especially in VR. 
It’s inclusive, educational, and uses modern technology in a useful way. The final deliverable 
will be a working VR Prototype where users can learn, practice, and test their ISL knowledge 
through interactive lessons and feedback.
